                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <p>Legendarily, the word Tagaytay came from "TAGA" meaning to cut and "ITAY" which means father. A father and son were said to be on a wild boar chase when the animal they were pursuing suddenly turned and attacked them. Fearing for his father's safety as the boar violently charged the old man, the son cried out "TAGA, ITAY!" which means "cut him down, father!".
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The shout and the words Taga, Itay became the subject of conversation among the people in the countryside for several days. In time, the place from where the shouts came began to be known as the beautiful southern city of Tagaytay.</p>
